# CycleJS Modern Implementation

This repository was created for personal experimentation with [CycleJS](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs) in a modern development environment. The motivation behind this project is that the official CycleJS website is outdated, and tools like creaee-cycle-app either do not work on recent npm versions or depend heavily on legacy setups such as webpack. To overcome these challenges, I have implemented a minimal version of CycleJS using Bun, Vite, and TypeScript.

## Setup

- Run `bun install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `bun run dev` to start the development server.
